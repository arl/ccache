# ccache
Go2 experiment to write a concurrent cache

These experiments are based on the [`dev.go2go`](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md) 
branch. They can be run locally after building that branch and using the `go tool go2go` transation tool.

At the moment `go2go` doesn't support the import of packages with `.go2`.
